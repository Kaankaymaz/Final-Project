    "This [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/columbine/imdb-dataset-sentiment-analysis-in-csv-format#:~:text=file_download-,Download%20(27%20MB),-more_vert) involves reviews of some random films imported from IMBD. It has two columns which are \"text\" and \"label. \"text\" contains text of reviews of films and \"label\" contains the sentiment of the reviews as \"0\",\"1\". The dataset is seperated as 3 folders. First one includes 40000 rows of reviews as train dataset,second one includes 5000 rows of reviews as test dataset and the last one includes 5000 rows of reviews as validation dataset."
